Food delivery system has found itself growing ever since we were hit by pandemic. According to stats online food ordering has now become roughly 40 % of the total restaurant sales in the United States. Hence it is now crucial to understand whether the websites and mobile application used for food ordering can customized to meet the userâ€™s satisfaction.
The purpose of Food-O-Logic is to recognize the pain points of the customer and thus creating a smooth and seamless experience for the customers. We intent to enhance the existing applications and find more efficient ways to make the customers navigate through the application easily. Additionally, we plan to provide users with a better navigation while they browse through some of their favourite cuisines. Lastly, we focus on simplifying the checkout process to have them place orders from their favourite restaurants.
